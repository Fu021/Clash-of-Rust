# Test status

This file records executed results and their limits. Update it only from an
actual run; never convert an unavailable or timed-out check into PASS.

## Local offline checks

Run on 2026-10-17 in the `Clash-of-Rust` worktree:

| Check | Result | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PowerShell module parser | PASS | Syntax only |
| `tests/windows-unit.ps1` | PASS, 50 assertions | Mocked host boundaries; no WSL, firewall, DNS or route mutation |
| `tests/linux_static_test.py` | PASS, 14 tests | Portable evidence/gate logic; no kernel operations |
| `tests/server_unit.py` | PASS, 4 tests | Offline VPS profile validation |
| `scripts/test-build-tools.py` | PASS, 36 tests, 1 skipped | Build/resource validation; Windows PE version read skipped locally |
| `scripts/test-workflow-artifacts.py` | PASS, 6 tests | Immutable artifact logic |
| Docker WFP ABI layout | PASS | Structure layout only; no WFP engine opened |
| Git whitespace check | PASS | `git diff --check` |

## Not executed locally

| Check | Status | Required environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rust format, Clippy, unit tests and builds | NOT_RUN | GitHub Actions or an explicitly permitted local Cargo build |
| Real WSL2/Hyper-V firewall and Windows-to-Linux calls | NOT_RUN | Disposable Windows runner and WSL environment |
| Linux namespace/nftables/WireGuard integration | NOT_RUN | Disposable root Linux runner |
| Real Docker WFP TCP/UDP loopback probe | NOT_RUN | Disposable administrator Windows runner |
| Cold boot, reboot, sleep/resume and network switch | NOT_RUN | Disposable WSL/Hyper-V environment |
| Actual German IPv4 exit and receiver-source evidence | NOT_RUN | Authorized VPS and controlled receiver |
| Docker functional protected egress | NOT_SUPPORTED | Independent adapter not implemented |
| Tailscale strict cold-start protection | BLOCKED | Supported cold-start boundary not established |

## Acceptance rule

Positive connectivity requires a receiver-observed nonce, the expected source
and counter evidence. A send success or timeout alone is not proof. A negative
test requires a deny counter, no receiver nonce and unchanged direct-path
counters. Real production fault injection is not authorized.

Update this document after GitHub Actions and any approved VPS/WSL acceptance
with the exact commit, run URL and per-scenario result.
